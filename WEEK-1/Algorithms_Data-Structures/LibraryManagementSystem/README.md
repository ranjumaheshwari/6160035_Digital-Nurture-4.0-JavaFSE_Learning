# 📚 Library Management System – Search Algorithms

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

## 🎯 Project Goal

Simulate a library system where books can be searched efficiently using both **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** techniques.

## 📁 Structure

- `Book.java` – Defines a book with ID, title, and author  
- `Library.java` – Holds an array of books and allows adding new entries  
- `SearchUtil.java` – Implements linear and binary search operations  
- `LibraryTest.java` – Demonstrates searching with both methods

## 💻 How to Compile & Run

```bash
javac *.java
java LibraryTest
