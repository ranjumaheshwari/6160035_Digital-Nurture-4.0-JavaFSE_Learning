#  Financial Forecasting â€“ Recursive Growth Predictor

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

##  Project Goal

Build a financial forecasting tool using **recursive algorithms** to predict future investment values based on fixed or fluctuating annual growth rates.

##  Structure

- `FinancialForecast.java` â€“ Contains recursive methods for fixed and variable rate forecasting  
- `ForecastTest.java` â€“ Tests the forecasting logic and prints year-by-year projections  

## ðŸ’» How to Compile & Run

Open terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
javac FinancialForecast.java ForecastTest.java
java ForecastTest

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- **Recursion** as a method of simplifying complex repetitive calculations  
- **Forecast modeling** using fixed and variable growth rates  
- **Linear recursive time complexity:** O(n)  
- **Optimization ideas:** iterative replacement, math functions like `Math.pow`, memoization
