# 📈 Observer Pattern – Stock Market Notification System

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

## 🎯 Project Goal

Implement the **Observer Design Pattern** to simulate a real-time stock market where multiple clients (observers) are automatically notified when stock prices change.

## 📁 Structure

- `Stock.java` - Subject interface for registering, removing, and notifying observers  
- `StockMarket.java` - Concrete subject that holds stock data and notifies observers  
- `Observer.java` - Interface for all observer clients  
- `MobileApp.java` - Observer implementation representing a mobile client  
- `WebApp.java` - Observer implementation representing a web client  
- `StockAppTest.java` - Test class to demonstrate stock price notifications

## 💻 How to Compile & Run

In terminal, inside the project folder:

```bash
javac *.java
java StockAppTest
