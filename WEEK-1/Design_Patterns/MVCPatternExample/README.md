# 🧑‍🎓 MVC Pattern – Student Record Manager

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

##  Project Goal

Implement the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern** to build a cleanly structured student record manager. This design separates business logic, user interface, and controller logic to promote scalability and maintainability.

##  Structure

- `Student.java` – Model representing student data (name, ID, grade)  
- `StudentView.java` – View responsible for displaying student details  
- `StudentController.java` – Controls the interaction between model and view  
- `StudentApp.java` – Test class to demonstrate MVC functionality

##  How to Compile & Run

In terminal, inside the project folder:

```bash
javac *.java
java StudentApp
