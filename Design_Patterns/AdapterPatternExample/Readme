# 🔌 Adapter Pattern – Payment Gateway Integration

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

## 🎯 Project Goal

Implement the **Adapter Design Pattern** to integrate multiple third-party payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) that have incompatible interfaces into a single, unified `PaymentProcessor` interface.

## 📁 Structure

- `PaymentProcessor.java` - Target interface with a standard `processPayment()` method  
- `PayPalGateway.java` - Third-party class with `sendPayment()`  
- `StripeGateway.java` - Third-party class with `makePayment()`  
- `PayPalAdapter.java` - Adapter for `PayPalGateway` to implement `PaymentProcessor`  
- `StripeAdapter.java` - Adapter for `StripeGateway` to implement `PaymentProcessor`  
- `PaymentTest.java` - Demonstrates processing payments via both adapters

## 💻 How to Compile & Run

In terminal, inside the project folder:

```bash
javac *.java
java PaymentTest
