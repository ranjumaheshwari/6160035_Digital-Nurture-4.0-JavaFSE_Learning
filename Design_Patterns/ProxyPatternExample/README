# 🖼️ Proxy Pattern – Lazy Image Viewer

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

## 🎯 Project Goal

Use the **Proxy Design Pattern** to implement lazy loading and caching in an image viewer system. This simulates loading remote images only when necessary, improving performance and resource management.

## 📁 Structure

- `Image.java` – Interface with a `display()` method  
- `RealImage.java` – Loads an image from a remote server and displays it  
- `ProxyImage.java` – Acts as a placeholder and only loads the real image on first access  
- `ImageViewerTest.java` – Demonstrates how ProxyImage handles loading and reusing images

## 💻 How to Compile & Run

In terminal, inside the project folder:

```bash
javac *.java
java ImageViewerTest
