# 🔍 E-commerce Platform – Product Search Function

**Developed as part of Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE**

##  Project Goal

Implement and analyze two search algorithms—**Linear Search** and **Binary Search**—to optimize product lookup performance in an e-commerce system.

##  Structure

- `Product.java` – Model class with attributes like `productId`, `productName`, and `category`  
- `SearchUtils.java` – Contains implementations of linear and binary search algorithms  
- `SearchTest.java` – Main class to test both search methods and output results

## 💻 How to Compile & Run

```bash
javac *.java
java SearchTest

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **Big O Notation** and asymptotic complexity analysis  
- **Best, Average, Worst-Case** performance scenarios  
- **Linear Search:** O(n) – Suitable for small or unsorted datasets  
- **Binary Search:** O(log n) – Requires sorted data, ideal for large datasets
